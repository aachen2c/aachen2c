# Hello, I'm Allen ! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a data scientist (MDS) with a passion for neural network applications in data. I love working on projects that make life easier for people and leverage lightweight and elegant solutions. Currently, I'm learning SQL and looking to collaborate on any data science projects involving SQL databases, natural language processing, or image recognition. 

## ðŸ›  Skills
- Languages: Python, R, SQL
- Tools & Technologies: PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, MatplotLib, Seaborn, ggplot2, shiny, dplyr, tibble, tidyr

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- NeuroCellCounter - End-to-end computer vision tool automating the counting of oligodendrocyte and microglial cells for PhD students with UC Davis neuropathology at Shriner's Children hospital. Leverages the open-source Cellpose cell-segmentation model as a base.
- Improving QA Model Performance with Cartographic Inoculation: Part 2 - Work-in-progress extension to a paper I wrote (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17498) in collaboration with another student during my time at UT Austin.
- HuntShowdownLoadoutTracker - An image recognition-based AI tool for tracking player loadout and performance metrics over time for the videogame Hunt: Showdown. Made for my friends.
- Other projects, such as my work on CNN-based PyStk agents, can be found in my private repositories. These projects were submitted as part of my master's program, so under UT Austin's Academic Integrity rules I can't post their code publicly. 

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
Feel free to ask me about the MSDS program at UT Austin, AI Language Models, data visualization and modeling tips, or any of the projects I've worked on !
