# Hello, I'm Allen ! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a data scientist (MDS) with a passion for neural network applications in data. I love working on projects that make life easier for people and leverage lightweight and elegant solutions. Currently, I'm learning SQL and looking to collaborate on any data science projects involving SQL databases, natural language processing, or image recognition. 

## ðŸ›  Skills
- Languages: Python, R, SQL
- Tools & Technologies: PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, MatplotLib, Seaborn, ggplot2, shiny, dplyr, tibble, tidyr

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- HuntShowdownLoadoutTracker - An image recognition-based AI tool for tracking player loadout and performance metrics over time for the game Hunt: Showdown. Made for my friends
- Improving QA Model Performance with Cartographic Inoculation: Part 2 - Work-in-progress extension to a paper I wrote (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17498) in collaboration with another student during my time at UT Austin.
- More projects (will eventually) be found in my repositories! 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- SQL, via "SQL Notes for Professionals"
- Keras and Tensorflow, via "Hands-On Machine-Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow"

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
